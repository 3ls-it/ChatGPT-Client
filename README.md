# ChatGPT Assitant Client

I put this together for personal use using bits and
pieces from the example code provided by OpenAI' documentation.
https://platform.openai.com/docs
  It was developed and is used on a Unix-like system with no
consideration for that Other OS, though it should work on
most any platform.
  The Assitants API is used here. You will need to choose the
ChatGPT model that works with this API, not all do.
